/**
 * This class represents a combined set of first order differential equations,
 * with at least a main set of equations expandable by some sets of additional
 * equations.
 * <p>
 * This class extends the {@link FirstOrderDifferentialEquations}. It allows to
 * identify which part of a complete set of differential equations correspond to
 * the main set and which part correspond to the expansion sets.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One typical use case is the computation of the jacobian matrix for some ODE.
 * The main set of equations corresponds to the raw ODE, and we add to this set
 * another bunch of equations which represent the jacobian matrix of the main
 * set. In that case, we want the integrator to use <em>only</em> the main set
 * to estimate the errors and hence the step sizes. It should <em>not</em> use
 * the additional equations in this computation.
 * The {@link ExpandableFirstOrderIntegrator integrator} will be able to know
 * where the main set ends and so where the expansion sets begin.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We consider that the main set always corresponds to the first equations and
 * the expansion sets to the last equations.
 * </p>
